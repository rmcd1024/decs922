This is a small package for the class Data Exploration, DECS-922, at
the [Kellogg School of
Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/). The package
currently contains 

* templates to produce slides and homework assignments; upon package installation these are automatically
available from RStudio's `rmarkdown` templates list. 
* the function `colorkey`, which assists with finding an appropriate
colorname as defined by R.

For example, to find a version of "orange" which does not contain "red" in the color name, do this:

```{r, out.width='70%'}
library(decs922)
colorkey(colortext = 'orange', excludetext = 'red')
```
