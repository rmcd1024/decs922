This is a small package for the class Data Exploration, DECS-922, at
the [Kellogg School of
Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/). The packge
currently contains templates to produce slides and homework
assignments; upon package installation these are automatically
available from RStudio's `rmarkdown` templates list. It also contains
the function `colorkey`, which assists with finding an appropriate
colorname as defined by R.

For example, to find the appropriate version of red:

```{r, out.width='70%'}
library(decs922)
colorkey('orange')
```
