# Problem No. 1

This is the ultimate authority on chunk options:
<https://yihui.org/knitr/options/>

This shows you the effect of the default chunk options above:

    x <- 1:10
    x
     [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

The following use different chunk options:

    x <- 1:10
    x
    ##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

Here we have `echo=FALSE`:

    ##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

## Part A

## Part B
