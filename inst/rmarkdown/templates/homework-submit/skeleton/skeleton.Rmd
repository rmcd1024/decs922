Feel free to delete or change anything in this document; this is
intended to provide a starting point for homework submissions. For
example, it sets reasonable chunk options and loads packages you are
likely to need.

Once you have customized this to your liking, you can save it in your
own directory and then use it as a template for future homework
assignments.

 
```{r setup, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE
                      ,collapse = TRUE
                      ,message = FALSE
                      ,warning = FALSE
                      ,error = FALSE
                      ,comment = NA)

```

# Problem No. xxx

This is the ultimate authority on chunk options:
https://yihui.org/knitr/options/ 

This shows you the effect of the  default chunk options above:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```

The following use different chunk options:

```{r, echo=TRUE, comment='##', collapse=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
x
```

Here we have `echo=FALSE`:

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment='##', collapse=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
x
```

## Part B
