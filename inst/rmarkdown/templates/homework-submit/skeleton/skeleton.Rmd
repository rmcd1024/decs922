Feel free to delete or change anything in this document; this is
intended to provide a starting point for homework submissions. For
example, it sets reasonable chunk options and loads packages you are
likely to need.

Once you have customized this to your liking, you can save it in your
own directory and then use it as a template for future homework
assignments.

 
```{r setup, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE     ## Show R code chunks
                     ,collapse = TRUE ## Show code and results together
                     ,message = FALSE ## Do not include R "messages" in the output
                     ,warning = FALSE ## Do not include R "warnings" in the output
                     ,error = FALSE   ## Do not include R "errors" in the output
                     ,comment = NA)   ## Do not preface R output with anything (default is "##")

```


# Problem

This is the ultimate authority on chunk options:
https://yihui.org/knitr/options/ 

This shows you the effect of the default chunk options above. With
`collapse=FALSE` the code and the output run together, and with
`comment=NA` there is no marker in front of the output.

```{r seq1}
x <- 1:10
x
```

Here we set `comment='##'`, which precedes output, and
`collapse=FALSE`, so the code and output have different backgrounds.

```{r seq2, echo=TRUE, comment='##', collapse=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
x
```

Here we have the same chunk options as before, except `echo=FALSE`:
output is shown, but the code is not shown.

```{r seq_no_echo, echo=FALSE, comment='##', collapse=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
x
```
