# What is this document?

This Rmarkdown template is intended to help you get started using
Rmarkdown. Please take a look at it --- there is a lot of information
about how rmarkdown works. Once you have examined it, feel free to
delete or change anything. To assist you in getting started, it
provides reasonable chunk options and loads packages you are likely to
need. But how you use this is up to you.

That said, to use it effectively, you should adhere to two rules:

1. R code appears *inside* chunks, that is in between the backticks
   shown below:


    ````{verbatim}
    
    Here is an example of a chunk:
    
    ```{r}
    ## this will show the first six rows of mtcars
    head(mtcars)
    ```
    ````




    Unless you have a very specific reason, don't put anything that is
    not code-related inside an R chunk. It's fine to include comments
    that document how the code works, but this is often not necessary.

1. Ordinary text appears outside of chunks (that is, outside those
   marks), and is formatted using markdown syntax.


Once you have customized this to your liking, you can save it to  use
as a template for future homework assignments.

 
```{r setup, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE     ## Show R code chunks
               ,collapse = TRUE ## Show code and results together
               ,message = FALSE ## Do not include R "messages" in the output
               ,warning = FALSE ## Do not include R "warnings" in the output
               ,error = FALSE   ## Do not include R "errors" in the output
               ,comment = NA   ## Do not preface R output with anything (default is "##")
)
```

Please take a moment to compare  the pdf and Rmd versions of this
document. If you're not yet comfortable with Rmarkdown, you will
learn a lot from this comparison. Ask if you have questions.


# Getting started

## References

This is the ultimate authority on chunk options:
https://yihui.org/knitr/options/ 

To learn more about Rmarkdown, [RStudio has a
tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html), and the
authors of Rmarkdown have written a book, which is [available
online](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

## Effects of chunk options

### Default options in this document

This shows you the effect of the default chunk options above. With
`collapse=FALSE` the code and the output run together, and with
`comment=NA` there is no marker in front of the output.

```{r seq1}
x <- 1:10
x
```

### Delineate output

We can override the global chunk options by specifying chunk-specific
options. Here we set `comment='##'`, so that the string `##` precedes
R output,^[This would have been the default had I not set `comment=NA` in the `setup` chunk above.] and `collapse=FALSE`, so the code and output have different
backgrounds and are further apart on the page.

```{r seq2, echo=TRUE, comment='##', collapse=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
x
```

### Show only the output, without code

Here we have the same chunk options as before, except for
`echo=FALSE`. In this case, you can see the output, but the code is
not shown. This is what you would use for business documents where it
would be inappropriate to show the code. In this case, if you wanted
to present the first 10 integers, you could do so like this, using
inline code that no one would know is code:

The first 10 integers are `r combine_words(1:10)`.

```{r seq_no_echo, echo=FALSE, comment='##', collapse=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
x
```

You also include R output directly in the text, like this: `r# paste0(x, collapse=' and ')`, or using `knitr::combine_words`: `r combine_words(x)`.

# Figures and Tables

If you have primarily created documents using Microsoft Office in the
past, you are accustomed to tinkering with your document to make it
look exactly the way you want. Although it is not obvious at first,
***markdown represents an entirely different philosophy to document
creation.*** In markdown, you decide on the function of text, and you
allow the software to format as appropriate. You can see examples in
this document, where different level headings are created by prefacing
the text with different numbers of hash marks (`#` vs `##` for
example). Once you become accustomed to using markdown, there is a
good chance you will conclude that formatting in Word is a waste of
your time. You should be focusing on writing, and allowing the
software to do the formatting. With Word, it is difficult to do
that. However, that's the purpose of  markdown: focus on content, not
appearance, and the appearance will nevertheless be high quality.

A prime example of this difference is the treatment of tables and
figures, which create difficulties because they are blocky chunks in
your text, and the question is where should they go? In all good
document processing software, tables and figures can either have a
fixed location or they can float. If fixed, this creates problems with
page formatting (what if a long table is at the bottom of a page?) If
they float, it means that the formatting algorithm will try to figure
out where to put them to adhere to conventional typographic
standards. Professional compositors (e.g. in formatting a book)
extensively use floating tables and figures. LaTeX (which is used to
create pdf output from rmarkdown) handles floats professionally, and
it is often used to publish books. Here is the general idea in rmarkdown.

* If you give a table a caption, it will float. If you don't give it a
caption, it will be whereever it appears in the flow of the
document. 
* Figures  float by default

You might ask: if figures and tables float, how can a reader find the
appropriate figure or table? The answer is that you use
*automatic cross-references*, where you refer to a table and a number
is automatically generated for the table caption and for your
reference. You can do the same with figures although the mechanics are
a little different. The ["official" discussion of cross-referencing in
the rmarkdown
cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/cross-ref.html)
will show you how to do something
different. It's up to you. The following examples will illustrate what
I do.

## Figures

This example illustrates how I cross-reference figures. (The
alternative is to use the `bookdown::pdf_document2` format and this
will provide a slightly different mechanism.) Be sure to look at the
Rmd file, as I have hidden the R chunks that generate the figure and
the tables.


Figure \ref{fig:fantasticfig} will appear somewhere.

```{r, fig.cap='This is a figure\\label{fig:fantasticfig}', echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg, color=as.factor(gear))) +
    geom_point()
```

## Tables

There are 3 tables in this section, one for each number of gears. They
are tables for 3 gears (Table \ref{tab:g3}), 4 gears (Table
\ref{tab:g4}) and 5 gears (Table  \ref{tab:g5}). As an exercise, you
can create all 3 tables within a loop. Note that they are all
auto-numbered: if you insert a preceding table, the table numbers will
increase appropriately.

If you decide you don't like the appearance of something (for example
the size of a graph or the appearance of a table), my strong advice is
to *wait until you are finished creating content before you start to
tinker with appearance*. You are wasting your time to do otherwise.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(filter(mtcars, gear == 3), booktabs = TRUE,
      caption = 'Cars with 3 gears', label = 'g3')
kable(filter(mtcars, gear ==  4), booktabs = TRUE,
      caption = 'Cars with 4 gears', label = 'g4')
kable(filter(mtcars, gear == 5), booktabs = TRUE,
      caption = 'Cars with 5 gears', label = 'g5')
```
