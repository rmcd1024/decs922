# What is this document?

This Rmarkdown template is intended to help you get started using
Rmarkdown. Once you have examined it, feel free to delete or change
anything. To assist you in getting started, it provides reasonable
chunk options and loads packages you are likely to need. But how you
use this is up to you.

That said, to use it effectively, you should adhere to two rules:

1. R code appears *inside* chunks, that is in between the backticks
   shown below:


    ````{verbatim}
    
    Here is an example of a chunk:
    
    ```{r}
    ## this will show the first six rows of mtcars
    head(mtcars)
    ```
    ````




    Unless you have a very specific reason, don't put anything not
    code-related inside an R chunk. It's fine to include comments that
    document how the code works, but this is often not necessary.

1. Ordinary text appears outside those marks, and is formatted using markdown


Once you have customized this to your liking, you can save it to  use
as a template for future homework assignments.

 
```{r setup, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE     ## Show R code chunks
               ,collapse = TRUE ## Show code and results together
               ,message = FALSE ## Do not include R "messages" in the output
               ,warning = FALSE ## Do not include R "warnings" in the output
               ,error = FALSE   ## Do not include R "errors" in the output
               ,comment = NA   ## Do not preface R output with anything (default is "##")
)
```

Please take a moment to compare  the pdf and Rmd versions of this
document. If you're not yet comfortable with Rmarkdown, you will
learn a lot from this comparison. Ask if you have questions.


# Getting started

## References

This is the ultimate authority on chunk options:
https://yihui.org/knitr/options/ 

To learn more about Rmarkdown, [RStudio has a
tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html), and the
authors of Rmarkdown have written a book, which is [available
online](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

## Effects of chunk options

### Default options in this document

This shows you the effect of the default chunk options above. With
`collapse=FALSE` the code and the output run together, and with
`comment=NA` there is no marker in front of the output.

```{r seq1}
x <- 1:10
x
```

### Delineate output

We can override the global chunk options by specifying chunk-specific
options. Here we set `comment='##'`, so that the string `##` precedes
R output,^[This would have been the default had I not set `comment=NA` in the `setup` chunk above.] and `collapse=FALSE`, so the code and output have different
backgrounds and are further apart on the page.

```{r seq2, echo=TRUE, comment='##', collapse=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
x
```

### Show only the output, without code

Here we have the same chunk options as before, except for
`echo=FALSE`. In this case, you can see the output, but the code is
not shown. This is what you would use for business documents where it
would be inappropriate to show the code. In this case, if you wanted
to present the first 10 integers, you could do so like this, using
inline code that no one would know is code:

The first 10 integers are `r combine_words(1:10)`.

```{r seq_no_echo, echo=FALSE, comment='##', collapse=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
x
```

You also include R output directly in the text, like this: `r# paste0(x, collapse=' and ')`, or using `knitr::combine_words`: `r combine_words(x)`.
