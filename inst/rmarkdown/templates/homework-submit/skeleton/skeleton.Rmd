Feel free to delete or change anything in this document; this is
intended to provide a starting point for homework submissions. For
example, it sets reasonable chunk options and loads packages you are
likely to need.

Once you have customized this to your liking, you can save it in your
own directory and then use it as a template for future homework
assignments.

 
```{r setup, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE     ## Show R code chunks
               ,collapse = TRUE ## Show code and results together
               ,message = FALSE ## Do not include R "messages" in the outp  ut
               ,warning = FALSE ## Do not include R "warnings" in the output
               ,error = FALSE   ## Do not include R "errors" in the output
               ,comment = NA   ## Do not preface R output with anything (default is "##")
)

To learn more about Rmarkdown, [RStudio has a
tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html), and the
authors of Rmarkdown have written a book, which is [available
online](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

## Effects of chunk options

### Default options in this document

This shows you the effect of the default chunk options above. With
`collapse=FALSE` the code and the output run together, and with
`comment=NA` there is no marker in front of the output.

```{r seq1}
x <- 1:10
x
```

### Delineate output

We can override the global chunk options by specifying chunk-specific
options. Here we set `comment='##'`, so that the string `##` precedes
R output,^[This would have been the default had I not set `comment=NA` in the `setup` chunk above.] and `collapse=FALSE`, so the code and output have different
backgrounds and are further apart on the page.

```{r seq2, echo=TRUE, comment='##', collapse=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
x
```

### Show only the output, without code

Here we have the same chunk options as before, except `echo=FALSE`:
output is shown, but the code is not shown.

```{r seq_no_echo, echo=FALSE, comment='##', collapse=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
x
```

You also include R output directly in the text, like this: `r# paste0(x, collapse=' and ')`, or using `knitr::combine_words`: `r combine_words(x)`.
