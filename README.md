This is a small package for the class Data Exploration, DECS-922, at the
[Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/).
The packge currently contains templates to produce slides and homework
assignments. It also contains the function `colorkey`, which assists
with finding an appropriate colorname as defined by R.

For example, to find the appropriate version of red:

``` r
library(decs922)
colorkey('red')
```
